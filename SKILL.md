# Memorial Design

A skill for creating works that transform statistics into individual human presence, making the abstract personal and preventing erasure through commemoration.

## When to Use

- When lives are being reduced to numbers
- When official memorials are absent, inadequate, or dishonest
- When communities need spaces for grief and remembrance
- When preventing future harm requires remembering past harm

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Gather the Names

A memorial begins with the specific:
- Compile individual names, not just counts
- Verify accuracy - errors dishonor
- Include information that makes each person real (age, relationship, aspiration)
- Work with families and communities directly

Numbers can be argued. Names cannot be dismissed.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Choose the Form

Match form to meaning:
- Names carved in stone: permanence, weight, official recognition
- Objects accumulated: scale, personal connection, each item a life
- Empty spaces: absence made visible, what should be there
- Light or sound: ephemeral, repeating, ongoing
- Digital: accessible everywhere, infinitely expandable, searchable

The form itself carries meaning about what the loss represents.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Design for Encounter

Plan how people will meet the memorial:
- Approach: How do you arrive? What do you see first?
- Scale: Does it overwhelm or invite intimacy?
- Interaction: Can you touch, leave something, participate?
- Time: How long does full experience take? Can it be partial?
- Individual vs. collective: Can you be alone with it? Together?

The physical or digital experience shapes the emotional response.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Include the Uncomfortable

Memorials must not sanitize:
- Who was responsible?
- What made this possible?
- What warnings were ignored?
- What has changed since?
- What hasn't?

Comfort is the enemy of remembrance. The memorial should prevent forgetting why it exists.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Plan for Continuation

Memorials live beyond their creation:
- How is it maintained?
- Can it be updated as more is learned?
- Who tends it?
- How does it resist vandalism or removal?
- What happens on anniversaries?

## Output Format

A memorial design including:
1. Who is being memorialized and why
2. Form selection and rationale
3. Encounter design (approach, scale, interaction)
4. Uncomfortable elements included
5. Maintenance and continuation plan
6. Community engagement approach

## Constraints

- Work with affected communities, not for them
- Verify all names and information
- Consider traumatic impact on survivors
- Plan for hostile responses (vandalism, removal attempts)
- Balance grief with accountability

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Design memorial for workers killed in preventable industrial accident

**Output**:
"Form: Replica of the worksite clock, stopped at the moment of the accident. Each minute mark replaced with a name of someone killed. Encounter: Placed at company headquarters entrance - employees must pass it daily. Interaction: QR codes link to each victim's story, contributed by families. Uncomfortable elements: Plaque lists specific safety violations that were known and ignored. Second panel shows executives' bonuses in the year the violations were documented. Continuation: Wreath-laying on anniversary, updated website as legal proceedings reveal more. Community: Families participated in design, union maintains site."

## Integration

Works with:
- **documentation-as-resistance**: Documentation provides accurate names and counts
- **scale-as-meaning**: Memorials often use scale to represent loss
- **structural-critique**: Memorial can expose systemic causes, not just individual losses
